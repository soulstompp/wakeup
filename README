Fixes

1.1 Was still referring to an old script wakeup_dev... Thanks to Tom Arnold for discovering that.


Introduction
This is another wakeup script for Asterisk. Why another one? Well, I 
have seen some great solutions out there prior to this one. I was in 
need of a solution that allowed for several calls though. I also wanted
to get some experience with AGI on Asterisk. 
This is a single script that does it all without any type of daemon, cron job or 
similar. Just a perl script that works almost completely out of the outgoing 
folder. I tried to make a clean solution with no dependencies outside of 
regular Asterisk.


Installation
Just drop the script in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/ (or wherever you have your
agi scripts). Make it executable. Make sure the /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing
and /var/spool/asterisk/wakeups exist with the correct permission.

In your dial plan, do something along the lines...
exten => *63,1,Answer
exten => *63,2,AGI(jwakeup.agi)
exten => *63,3,Hangup


Features
* Single script
* No daemon, no crontab
* Can schedule an unlimited amount of wakeup calls
* Can list them and delete individual calls
* Reoccurring wakeups as well as "one-time" wakeups
* Snooze
* Allows you to press keys in the middle of prompts

Dependencies
Asterisk 1.4 (could work on 1.2 as well, I am not sure)
General perl with Time
Unix touch command
Core sounds and extra sounds

How it works
The program works almost completely out of the /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing
directory (there is a use of /var/spool/asterisk/wakeups as well, but that is
for temporary files and you could instead use /tmp if you want).
The solution is based on typical Asterisk call files. If you don't run 
asterisk as root, make sure you have write permissions in the above directories.
The program uses the unix touch command to set the time of the wakeup. Make 
sure the path to touch is correctly reflected in the program 
(my $TOUCH = "/usr/bin/touch").

Contact
I am not setting out to further develop this script. If you find bugs please 
let me know (jonas_arndt@comcast.net) and I might fix them :-) 
I have been using this script myself for a couple of months so I am convinced
that it runs fine. There might still be corner cases that I have not run into

Thanks,
